I will provide you a DataFrame and a set of commands. You will know they are the commands because they will be written right after I type 'commands:'. You will then return a new DataFrame by following said commands.The new DataFrame should be formatted as a csv, delimited by commas. Don't add explanations, only return tabular data.No explanations.I can't stress enough that i dont want explanations. DataFrame: {og_data}. Commands: {commands}
